The best way to install python is to download python from the python.org website! 

To make sure you have installed python correctly is opening up your `terminal` and typing `python --version`

Installing on macOS
> There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to > run git from the Terminal the very first time.

> $ git --version
> If you donâ€™t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.


#### Make a github account
If you have not made a github account, please do so! You can sign up for one here: https://github.com/

#### Set your commit email in github / git 
Now that you have a github account and are looking to make contributions you have to make sure your email address is correctly linked!

#### Make a github folder in your computer file system 
Not necessarily needed as you can have a git repository in any folder, however just for organizational sake I would recommend making one! I have my github folder in my documents folder.
